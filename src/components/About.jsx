          <p>
            I studied Computer Science and Data Science at UC Berkeley, where I spend a lot of time learning beyond formal coursework. I'm drawn to problems that require both systems thinking and mathematical reasoning, and I approach learning through independent study and practical exploration. My experience ranges from production backend services to applied machine learning and research.
